YouTube UI and UX principles


•	Readily accessible content: The content on each page is laid out in a well-structured manner. The buttons, tabs and hovers make for easy user experience.
•	Consistency: the formatting of each page is the same throughout, the styles and structure does not change across pages or browsers. 
•	Clarity: The style is clear and clean. It is easy to find content within each page.
•	Feedback: the page provides feedback on actions taken by the user, such as when uploading the video.
•	Recognisable features and site: due to the colours and formatting, the YouTube page is easily recognisable.
•	User interaction: the user can have control over their actions, and they can choose what they desire to do.
•	Follows design standards follows the standards of a well-designed page which is created for the user.
•	Elemental hierarchy: the most important information is placed at the top, and information flows from top to bottom and from left to right.
•	Simple: I find the website easy to use, it is simple and does not require advanced skills to navigate through.
•	User free and in-control
